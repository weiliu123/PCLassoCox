PCLasso(
  x,

  group,
  penalty = c("grLasso", "grMCP", "grSCAD", "gel", "cMCP"),

}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A n x p matrix of gene expression measurements with n samples and p
genes.}

\item{y}{The time-to-event outcome, as a two-column matrix or \code{Surv}
object. The first column should be time on study (follow up time); the second
column should be a binary variable with 1 indicating that the event has
occurred and 0 indicating (right) censoring.}

\item{group}{A list of groups. The feature (gene) names in \code{group}
should be consistent with the feature (gene) names in \code{x}.}

\item{penalty}{The penalty to be applied to the model. For group selection,
one of grLasso, grMCP, or grSCAD. For bi-level selection, one of gel or cMCP.
See \code{grpsurv} in the R package \code{grpreg} for details.}

\item{standardize}{Logical flag for \code{x} standardization, prior to
fitting the model. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{...}{Arguments to be passed to \code{grpsurv} in the R package
\code{grpreg}.}

\description{
Construct a PCLasso model based on a gene expression matrix, survival data,
and protein complexes.
}
\details{
The PCLasso model is a prognostic model which selects important
predictors at the protein complex level to achieve accurate prognosis and
identify risk protein complexes. The PCLasso model has three inputs: a gene
expression matrix, survival data, and protein complexes. It estimates the
correlation between gene expression in protein complexes and survival data
at the level of protein complexes.  Similar to the traditional Lasso-Cox
model, PCLasso is based on the Cox PH model and estimates the Cox regression
coefficients by maximizing partial likelihood with regularization penalty.
The difference is that PCLasso selects features at the level of protein
complexes rather than individual genes. Considering that genes usually
function by forming protein complexes, PCLasso regards genes belonging to the
same protein complex as a group, and constructs a l1/l2 penalty based on the
sum (i.e., l1 norm) of the l2 norms of the regression coefficients of the
group members to perform the selection of features at the group level. Since
a gene may belong to multiple protein complexes, that is, there is overlap
between protein complexes, the classical group Lasso-Cox model for
non-overlapping groups may lead to false sparse solutions. The PCLasso model
deals with the overlapping problem of protein complexes by constructing a
latent group Lasso-Cox model. And by reconstructing the gene expression
matrix of the protein complexes, the latent group Lasso-Cox model is
transformed into a non-overlapping group Lasso-Cox model in an expanded
space, which can be directly solved using the classical group Lasso method.
Through the final sparse solution, we can predict the patient's risk score
based on a small set of protein complexes and identify risk protein complexes
that are frequently selected to construct prognostic models.
