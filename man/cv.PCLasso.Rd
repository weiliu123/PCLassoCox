\title{Cross-validation for \code{PCLasso}}
\usage{
cv.PCLasso(
  x,
  y,
  group,
  penalty = c("grLasso", "grMCP", "grSCAD", "gel", "cMCP"),
  nfolds = 5,
  standardize = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A n x p design matrix of gene expression measurements with n samples
and p genes, as in \code{PCLasso}.}

\item{y}{The time-to-event outcome, as a two-column matrix or \code{Surv}
object, as in \code{PCLasso}. The first column should be time on study
(follow up time); the second column should be a binary variable with 1
indicating that the event has occurred and 0 indicating (right) censoring.}

\item{group}{A list of groups as in \code{PCLasso}. The feature (gene) names
in \code{group} should be consistent with the feature (gene) names in
\code{x}.}

\item{penalty}{The penalty to be applied to the model. For group selection,
one of grLasso, grMCP, or grSCAD. For bi-level selection, one of gel or
cMCP. See \code{grpsurv} in the R package \code{grpreg} for details.}

\item{nfolds}{The number of cross-validation folds. Default is 5.}

\item{standardize}{Logical flag for \code{x} standardization, prior to
fitting the model. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{...}{Arguments to be passed to \code{cv.grpsurv} in the R package
\code{grpreg}.}
}
\value{
An object with S3 class "cv.PCLasso" containing:
\item{cv.fit }{
An object of class "cv.grpsurv".}
\item{group.dt }{
Groups with  features
(genes) not included in \code{x} being filtered out. }
}
\description{
Perform k-fold cross validations for the PCLasso model with grouped
covariates over a grid of values for the regularization parameter
\code{lambda}.
}
\details{
The function calls \code{PCLasso} \code{nfolds} times, each time leaving out
1/\code{nfolds} of the data. The cross-validation error is based on the
deviance. The numbers for each outcome class are balanced across the folds;
i.e., the number of outcomes in which y is equal to 1 is the same for each
fold, or possibly off by 1 if the numbers do not divide evenly.
\code{cv.PCLasso} uses the approach of calculating the full Cox partial
likelihood using the cross-validated set of linear predictors. See
\code{cv.grpsurv} in the R package \code{grpreg} for details.
