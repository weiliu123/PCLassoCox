Description: The PCLasso model is a prognostic model which selects important
predictors at the protein complex level to achieve accurate prognosis and
identify risk protein complexes. The PCLasso model has three inputs: a gene
expression matrix, survival data, and protein complexes. It estimates the
correlation between gene expression in protein complexes and survival data at
the level of protein complexes.  Similar to the traditional Lasso-Cox model,
PCLasso is based on the Cox PH model and estimates the Cox regression
coefficients by maximizing partial likelihood with regularization penalty. The
difference is that PCLasso selects features at the level of protein complexes
rather than individual genes. Considering that genes usually function by forming
protein complexes, PCLasso regards genes belonging to the same protein complex
as a group, and constructs a l1/l2 penalty based on the sum (i.e., l1 norm) of
the l2 norms of the regression coefficients of the group members to perform the
selection of features at the group level. Since a gene may belong to multiple
protein complexes, that is, there is overlap between protein complexes, the
classical group Lasso-Cox model for non-overlapping groups may lead to false
sparse solutions. The PCLasso model deals with the overlapping problem of
protein complexes by constructing a latent group Lasso-Cox model. And by
reconstructing the gene expression matrix of the protein complexes, the latent
group Lasso-Cox model is transformed into a non-overlapping group Lasso-Cox
model in an expanded space, which can be directly solved using the classical
group Lasso method. Through the final sparse solution, we can predict the
patient's risk score based on a small set of protein complexes and identify risk
protein complexes that are frequently selected to construct prognostic models.
